Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis financial is a financial consulting company that had a RESTful web API. They wanted to protect this application, in particular protecting sensitive financial data. 

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I think I did a good job of identifying major issues just by looking at the code through manual inspection. It is important to code securely because not doing this could cause sensitive data to be compromised. Secure software helps a company, because this will help their reputation and make sure their data isnt compromised. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found the process of determining vulnerability severity to be quite challenging. This process is quite tedious and requires a good bit of research. 

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
In the future, I think I would use vulnerability documentation and better use the security best practices to determine mitigation techniques. I approached the need to increase layers of security by employing the practices for security we learned throughout the course into my code. 

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured the software was functional and secure by manually inspecting the code for any issues that could cause it to not work. After refactoring code, it is important to rerun the dependency check to make sure nothing new was introduced. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The maven dependency check tool was incredibly useful throughout this entire course. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would like to show that I am capable of identifying software vulnerabilities and creating a plan to overcome these vulnerabilities.
